# CapstoneProject
Work for Bessine and Walterbach LLC
The code was written in Visual Basic and is used for automating their template work. 

Notes: 
1. I had to manually count lines since VBA does not have line numbers.
2. Since I am updating their files, I will include file names and code that I added to a seperate file so that it can be reviewed.
3. Any excel edits made to the template (ie anything that is NOT Visual Basic) will not be counted as a "line" of code.
